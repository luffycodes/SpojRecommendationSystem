Collaborative Filtering for Problems on SPOJ using Spatio-Temporal Approach

code1.cpp - 
computes total number of submissions for an item in the data, total accepted submissions, distinct users attempted, distinct user accepted
and it also computes all submission for a user, accepted ones, distinct problems he/she tried and distinct accepted problems

code2.cpp - 
parser to parse the user_items to write the name of problems with less than a threshold distinct users in a different file

code3.cpp -

each matrix element has a pair, one is the total submissions by the user for the problem and the second is the number of accepted submissions for
the problem
